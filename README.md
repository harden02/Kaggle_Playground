This notebook consists of my EDA/exploration notebook from Kaggle's mental health playground competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e11). I performed EDA, cleansing, feature engineering, and experimented with various gradient boosting algorithms to submit to the competition. 
The notebook is rather messy as it basically maps out my thought process as I went along the competition. 
I finished placed 1246/2685
